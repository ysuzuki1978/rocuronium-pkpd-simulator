# Rocuronium PK/PD Simulator

A web-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulator for rocuronium neuromuscular blocking agent, implementing five validated pharmacokinetic models with age and sex covariates for effect-site concentration prediction.

## Overview

This application provides real-time simulation of rocuronium plasma and effect-site concentrations using established pharmacokinetic models. The simulator incorporates patient-specific covariates (age, sex, body weight) to predict neuromuscular blockade progression and recovery, supporting clinical education and research applications.

## Features

- **Five Pharmacokinetic Models**: Wierda, Szenohradszky, Cooper, Alvarez-Gomez, and McCoy models
- **Covariate Integration**: Age and sex effects on pharmacodynamic parameters
- **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive graphs showing plasma concentration, effect-site concentration, and TOF ratio
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality with responsive design
- **Clinical Validation**: Computational logic validated against published reference standards

## Implementation Details

### Pharmacokinetic Models

The application implements compartmental models with the following parameters:

- **Three-compartment models**: Wierda, Szenohradszky, Cooper, Alvarez-Gomez
- **Two-compartment model**: McCoy
- **Numerical integration**: Fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for plasma concentrations
- **Effect-site modeling**: First-order kinetics with Euler integration

### Pharmacodynamic Model

Sigmoid E_max model implementation:
```
Effect = E₀ + (E_max - E₀) × [Ce^γ / (Ce₅₀^γ + Ce^γ)]
```

Where:
- Ce₅₀ = θ₂ + (age - 50) × θ₅
- γ = θ₃ + (age - 50) × θ₆ + sex × θ₇ (model-dependent)
- ke₀ = θ₄ + (age - 50) × θ₈ (model-dependent)

### Validation

Computational accuracy verified against:
- Masui, K., Ishigaki, S., Tomita, A. et al. Rocuronium pharmacodynamic models for published five pharmacokinetic models: age and sex are covariates in pharmacodynamic models. *J Anesth* 32, 709–716 (2018). DOI: 10.1007/s00540-018-2543-3

# Confirmation of Computational Logic for the Rocuronium PK/PD Simulator

**Original Validation Date:** 2025-07-11  
**Public Release Version 1.0.0:** 2025-07-13

**Subject:** Verification of the computational logic implemented in the Rocuronium PK/PD Simulator application against the reference publication by Masui et al. (2018).

## 1. Introduction

This document serves to confirm that the computational logic of the Rocuronium PK/PD Simulator (Version 1.0.0), is a faithful and accurate implementation of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models described in the following reference paper:

- **Reference:** Masui, K., Ishigaki, S., Tomita, A., & Otake, H. (2018). Rocuronium pharmacodynamic models for published five pharmacokinetic models: age and sex are covariates in pharmacodynamic models. *Journal of Anesthesia*, 32(5), 709–716. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-018-2543-3

The verification was conducted by analyzing the application's source code (`js/models.js` and `js/calculator.js`) and comparing its algorithms and parameters against the methods and data presented in the reference publication.

## 2. Verification of Model Implementation

### 2.1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Models

The application correctly implements the five 3-compartment (and one 2-compartment) PK models as specified in **Table 1** of the reference paper.

- **Models Verified:** Wierda, Szenohradszky, Cooper, Alvarez-Gomez, and McCoy.
- **Parameters Verified:** The rate constants (`k10`, `k12`, `k21`, `k13`, `k31`) and the body-weight-indexed volume of the central compartment (`v1_bw`) for each model are identical to those listed in the publication.
- **Numerical Method:** The plasma concentration over time is calculated by solving the system of differential equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, a standard and robust numerical integration technique appropriate for this type of compartmental modeling.

### 2.2. Pharmacodynamic (PD) Models

The application accurately implements the corresponding PD models, including the influence of covariates, as detailed in **Table 2** of the reference paper.

- **PD Parameters (`θ` values):** The base typical values for `Ce50` (effect-site concentration at 50% effect), `γ` (steepness factor), and `ke0` (equilibration rate constant), represented by `θ` parameters in the source code, are identical to those in Table 2.
- **Covariate Effects (Age and Sex):** The application correctly incorporates the influence of age and sex on the PD parameters. The formulas used to adjust `Ce50`, `γ`, and `ke0` based on patient age (relative to a 50-year-old) and sex (0 for male, 1 for female) precisely match the equations specified in the footnotes of Table 2.
- **Effect Calculation:** The relationship between the effect-site concentration (`Ce`) and the Train-of-Four (TOF) ratio is calculated using the Sigmoid Emax model, consistent with the equation provided in the paper. The implementation correctly uses the calculated `Ce`, `Ce50`, and `γ` to determine the neuromuscular block effect.

## 3. Conclusion

The computational engine of the Rocuronium PK/PD Simulator is a precise and faithful implementation of the scientific models published by Masui et al. (2018). The pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters, and the mathematical relationships involving patient-specific covariates (age and sex) have been verified to be accurate.

Therefore, the calculations performed by this application can be considered a valid representation of the models described in the reference paper.
